# Adopt, don't Shop

Welcome to the "Adopt, Don't Shop" app! This application aims to connect animals needing homes to people who are searching for a pet. It can be used by pet seekers to fill out applications for specific pets, and by admins to approve or reject those applications.

## Features
* Browse available pets and see specific information, such as name, breed, age and if the animal is adoptable or not.
* Search for pets by name to make it easier to find the pet you're looking for.
* Apply to adopt a pet by filling out an application with your name, address, phone number, and description of why you would be a good pet owner.
* View all applications you've submitted and see their status (pending, approved, or rejected).
* Admins can approve or reject applications.


## Setup
* Fork and clone this repo
* Install gem packages by running 'bundle install'
* Set up the database by running 'rails db:{create,migrate,seed}'
